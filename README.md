# TetrisAI
Tetris AI is a continuation of my OpenAI showcase. This is NOT about creating an AI that can play tetris.

The goal is to code entirely using OpenAI's tool, ChatGPT. The ideas for the code structure, the game logic and all the functions are created by ChatGPT using prompts. In addition, the webpage, the style (yes even the stylish title block on the right) and the gamemode toggles are created by ChatGPT. Minimal human intervention into the actual code was done, though some was necessary. If possible, the prompt would be changed to create functiona; code rather than changing the code itself.

## Opinion

Coding with ChatGPT is almost as hard as coding normally. It is almost like collaborating with another person while coding, sometimes there are miscommunication and all the time it is hard to give an accurate description of my own vision and ideas. Sometimes ChatGPT does not pay the closest attention to the prompts beforehand, and would get confused about how much has been done, especially if there is not as much context given in its prompt. 

As much effort is saved by not coding all the minutia is also spent trying to understand the code and fix any problems when they arrive. As programmers know, its better to have individual programmers working on their own part of a larger whole than have every programmer collaberate on every aspect of the project. Again, ChatGPT had its own ideas and I had mine. Communication between us was not the easiest thing to do. 

However, ChatGPT provided many noticeable improvements. I did not have to spend long thinking about the logic of the system, ChatGPT instantly came up with it. The logic held consistently, and I spent very little energy coming up with the small details of more complex problems, like rotating pieces. In the end, ChatGPT is a tool not a replacement, but I am still glad I could create a Tetris clone with its power!
